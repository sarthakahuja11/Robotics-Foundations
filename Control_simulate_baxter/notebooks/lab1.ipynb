    "**NOTE:** If you have attended Lecture 2 \"Introduction to ROS\", you do not need to read this section! Jump to the \"Creating a ROS package\" section :)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of ROS is **to provide OS-like functionalities for specialised robotic agents, under an open-source license**. The creators based ROS around five fundamental design principles: peer-to-peer, tools-based, multi-lingual, thin, and open-source. It currently supports four languages: C++, Python, Octave and LISP with other language ports in development. To be language-independent, ROS uses a language-neutral interface to define messages sent between modules. So, the services it offers are similar to the ones found in most software middleware (e.g. XMLRPC servers and Django in WAD2!). For instance, ROS offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hardware abstraction, which enables the development of portable code which can interface with a large number of robot platforms\n",
    "- Low-level device control, facilitating robotic control\n",
    "- Inter-process communication via message passing\n",
    "- Software package management, which ensures the framework is easily extensible\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of all the programs running on ROS is an anonymised form of the publisher-subscriber pattern. Processes are termed **nodes** in ROS. Nodes form part of a ROS graph (Figure 1) that keeps track of running nodes and all the communications between them at a fine-grained scale. Since most robotic systems are assumed to comprise numerous components, all requiring control or I/O services, the ROS node architecture expects that each computation is delegated to a separate node, thus reducing the complexity involved in developing monolithic control systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "![ros_graph.png](imgs/ros_graph.png)\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><b>Figure 1: Example of a ROS node graph</b><br></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of using ROS is that it allows the debugging of a node alongside other running nodes. The latter is facilitated by the modular structure. It also means people working in robotics do not have to reinvent the wheel for each project, since ROS nodes and packages can be easily shared, creating a vibrant community. Additionally, all other nodes can be started and left running, and developers can edit and restart the ROS node they are working on. The ability to stop, edit and restart ROS codes are incredibly beneficial and handy as the software system can get very complicated! ([http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/icraoss09-ROS.pdf](http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/icraoss09-ROS.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Newly-created nodes can communicate using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Topics\n",
    "- RPC Services\n",
    "- Parameter Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common communication mechanism involves transmitting and receiving messages asynchronously on a strongly-typed named bus or log called a **topic**. Nodes can create, publish or subscribe to a topic, and send and receive data in the form of messages of a predefined type, at a set frequency measured in Hz. Built for unidirectional streaming communication topics, the software developer (aka you!) benefits from anonymous publish/subscribe semantics, thus removing communicating nodes' awareness of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in cases where the many-to-many transport provided by topics is not appropriate, ROS offers a form of node interaction based on the request/reply paradigm of remote procedure calls. These **services** are defined by a pair of messages, of which one is the request sent to a node, and the other is the reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **parameter server** takes the form of a globally-viewable dictionary of typically static, non-binary data points. The server is designed primarily for the storage of shared configuration parameters, and does not uphold any premise of high performance and should not be seen as a global variable store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above three communication types support the smooth integration of custom user code within a ROS ecosystem and unify the different APIs that would typically be needed to access relevant system information and low-level drivers of a robot (e.g. sensor data, actuator positions, motor positions, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ROS Filesystem\n",
    "Similar to an operating system, a ROS workspace is divided into folders, and these folders have files that describe their functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Packages**: Packages form the atomic level of ROS. A package has the minimum structure and content to create a program within ROS. It may have ROS runtime processes (nodes), configuration files, and so on. In the following sections, you will create a ROS package.\n",
    "* **Package manifests**: Package manifests provide information about a package, licenses, dependencies, compilation flags, and so on. A package manifest is managed with a file called package.xml.\n",
    "* **Message (msg) types**: A message is an information that a process sends to other processes. ROS has several standard types of messages. Message descriptions are stored in `<package name>/msg/MyMessageType.msg`.\n",
    "* **Service (srv) types**: Service descriptions, stored in `<package name>/srv/MyServiceType.srv`, define the request and response data structures for services provided by each process in ROS."

    "## Creating a ROS package\n",
    "To develop software in ROS for robots, you usually create a workspace where you will store ROS packages and related configurations and files. In general terms, the workspace is a folder tree that contains packages, those packages include your source files, and the workspace provides you with a way to compile those packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Virtual Machine, we have configured a ROS workspace for you with the [Baxter robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_(robot)) SDK. To separate workspaces and allow you to save your progress, you need to create a new workspace which will be located in: `~/workspace/rf_ws` (`~` is a shortcut to the user's home directory). So, open a terminal and type the following (to open a terminal in the virtual machine, minimise this Firefox and you will see a shortcut to the default terminal in the Desktop):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "mkdir -p ~/rf_ws/src\n",
    "cd ~/rf_ws/src\n",
    "catkin_init_workspace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above commands, you would have created an `src` folder where your ROS packages will be located. Now, you need to create a package in the workspace called `lab1_pkg` that uses `rospy` (the Python ROS API) and some standard ROS message packages, robot messages and Baxter's SDK interface. For this, type the following commands in the terminal you opened recently (if you close it, you need to open and a new terminal and navigate to `~/rf_ws/src`):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "catkin_create_pkg lab1_pkg rospy geometry_msgs sensor_msgs control_msgs trajectory_msgs baxter_core_msgs baxter_interface\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first argument, `lab1_pkg`, is the name of your new package. The following arguments are the package names the new package depends on. You must include these because the ROS build system needs to know the package dependencies to keep the builds up-to-date efficiently and to generate any required dependencies. **Tip:** you can find out more about these ROS message packages and other packages by searching for them in Google, e.g. https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=geometry_msgs+ros\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the `catkin_create_pkg` command, there will be a package directory called `lab1_pkg` inside the workspace. The Figure below shows the package in the file manager; to open the file manager, minimise Firefox or change virtual desktop by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+Left`, click on the \"Home\" icon, then navigate to `~/rf_ws/src`. If you double-click on the \"lab1_pkg\" folder, you will find the following files:\n",

    "* `CMakeLists.txt`, a starting point for the build script for this package\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the annoying things while working with ROS is the need to open multiple terminals for each node. ROS creators have somewhat mitigated this by grouping nodes in `launch` files such as the one you just used to run the simulation above (rant over...). That is, [`roslaunch`](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch) is a tool that allows you to run several ROS nodes, declare ROS parameters, pass command line arguments to ROS nodes, and so on. A `roslaunch` file is structured as [XML](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML) and run a [`roscore`](http://wiki.ros.org/roscore) in the background. The `roscore` is the central hub where topics, services and parameters are stored and must be running so ROS nodes can communicate with each other.\n",

If `rosrun` cannot find your `lab1_pkg` package, run `source devel/setup.bash` while you are in your workspace, i.e. `~/rf_ws`.\n",
